# Crop Prediction

## Project Description
Developed a crop prediction application using machine learning algorithms and the Streamlit library in Python. The application takes input parameters such as soil composition (Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium), environmental factors (temperature, humidity, rainfall), and soil pH to predict the most suitable crop for cultivation. Two versions of the application were created: one using a simple Python script and the other using Streamlit for a user-friendly web interface.

## Skills Developed
- Machine learning model development
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model deployment with Streamlit
- User interface design
- Python programming

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn (DecisionTreeClassifier)
- Streamlit
